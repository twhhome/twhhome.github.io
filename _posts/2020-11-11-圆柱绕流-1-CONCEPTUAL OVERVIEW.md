# 1.1 Regions of disturbed flow
A particularly large and usually unsteady separated flow is generated by so-called _bluff_ bodies.

Figure 1.1 shows the division of the disturbed flow field into four regions:
1. one narrow region of retarded flow
2. two boundary layers attached to the surface of the cylinder
3. two sidewise regions of displaced and accelerated flow
4. one wide downstream region of separated flow called the wake

![fig1.1](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.1.jpg)

The unexpectedly high fluctuations in velocity are found in the upstream retarded flow region, which significantly increase local heat transfer. The inherently unstable retarded flow forms unsteady flow structures in a streamline direction.

The boundary layers around the cylinder are subjected to a favourable pressure gradient followed by a small region of adverse pressure gradient before separation. The separated boundary layers continue to develop downstream as _fre shear layers_ abd they initially border the _near-wake_.

The displaced flow is vigorously entrained by the low pressure in the wake. The extent of the displaced region is strongly affected by the vicinity of confining walls of wind or water tunnels known as the _blockage effect_.

Large flow structures are formed in the near-wake and gradually decay along the wake. The formation and decay of the flow structures in the wake depend on the state of flow which may be laminar, transitional, or turbulent.

# 1.2 Transition in disturbed regions
Figure 1.2 shows the development of transitions with \\(Re\\) in three disturbed regions: wake(TrW), shear layers(TrSL) and boundary layers(TrBL).

![fig1.2](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.2.jpg)

Each transition is sensitive to very small disturbances of various kinds. The disturbances can initiate transitions at a lower \\(Re\_c\\) and sometimes may significantly modify the resulting flow structures. This means that \\(Re\\) is expected to be a single _governing_ parameter only for the _disturbance-free_ flow around cylinders.

The first transition TrW sketched in Fig. 1.2(a) occurred in the wake, and was discovered in the range of \\(Re\\) one order of magnitude lower than in pipe flow experiments. Turbulance gradually developed and spread all along the wake, but the free shear layers bordering the near-wake remained laminar.

The second transition TrSL in Fig. 1.2(b) occurred in the free shear layers. The transition region moved with increasing \\(Re\\) along the free shear layers towards the separation and affected the length and width of the near-wake.

The third transition reaches the boundary layers at separation in Fig. 1.2(c). Subsequent researchers gradually revealed an extremely complicated interaction between separation and transition, resulting in different flow structures until finally the boundary layer became fully turbulent before the separation line.

The transition in boundary layers continues to move towards the stagnation point with rising \\(Re\\) as sketched in Fig. 1.2(d). At the upper end of TrBL, the transition reaches the retarded region and this is the end of the third and final transition because all regions of the disturbed flow are fully turbulent. It may be re-interated that laminar and fully turbulent states of flow past circular cylinders are separated by three distinct transition states taking place sequentially in the different disturbed regions.

# 1.3 Governing and influencing parameters
The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) has been singled out as the _governing_ parameter for idealized _disturbance-free_ flow around a _nominally_ two-dimensional cylinder. When a given _influencing_ parameter exceeds a certain magnitude it may become the _governing_ parameter in some transition states. 

However, when an influencing parameter becomes a governing one it cannot be precisely defined. Sarpkaya(1983) points out that what may be an influencing parameter for a given set of governing parameters could be a governing parameter for another set of governing parameters.

![fig1.3](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.3.jpg)

Some typical examples of the most frequently encountered influencing parameters are irregular, steady and periodic disturbances. The most common disturbance in all practical applications is _free stream turbulance_, Fig. 1.3(a). It is described by the intensity \\(Ti\\), scale \\(Ts\\) and frequency spectrum FS of random three-dimensional fluctuations of velocity. The free stream turbulance strongly affects all three transitions in the disturbed regions.

Another kind of irregular disturbance which is important for most practical applications is _surface roughness_, Fig. 1.3(b). This is characterized by at least two influencing parameters: relative size of roughness \\(K/D\\) and its texture. 

An additional steady disturbance occurs in most experiments and it is not present in applications. That is the wall _blockage_. The confining walls of wind and water tunnels shown in Fig. 1.3(c) restrict the disturbed flow sidewise and impose an additional pressure gradient. For large blockage ratios, the transitions in both the boundary and free shear layers may be affected. An asymmetric 'blockage' is induced by the vicinity of a single boundary, Fig. 1.3(d). For small gap to diameter ratios, \\(G/D\\) may become a governing parameter.

A disguised kind of disturbance is the _end effect_. In most tests both ends of the cylinder penetrate the boundary layers of the side walls as shown in Fig. 1.3(e) and the ensuing interaction affects the flow along the span of the cylinder. The _aspect ratio_ \\(L/D\\) is an ever-present influencing parameter in the simulation of a 'nominally' two-dimensional cylinder. The aspect ratio becomes a governing parameter for a short finite cylinder with a free end, see Fig. 1.3(f).

A powerful disturbance which is capable of overriding all other disturbances is the transvers or streamwise oscillation of the cylinder beyond a threshold amplitude, Fig. 1.3(g) and Fig. 1.3(h), respectively. The amplitude and frequency of either free or forced oscillations may become the governing parameters within a certain range of the free stream velocity.

# 1.4 Disturbance-free flow regimes
The flow regimes are expected to be confined within a _fixed_ range of \\(Re\\) only for _genuinely_ disturbance free flows. All influencing parameters are kept as small as possible.

The state of flow may be fully laminar L, any one of the three transitions TrW, TrSL, and TrBL, or fully turbulent T.

# 1.5 Laminar state of flow, L
There are at least three basic flow regimes:
* L1: 'creeping' flow or _non-separation_ regime; \\(0<Re<4\;to\;5\\)
* L2: steady separation or _closed near-wake_ regime; \\(4\;to\;5<Re<30\;to\;48\\)
* L3: _periodic laminar_ regime; \\(30\;to\;48<Re<180\;to\;200\\)

Creeping flow as seen in Fig. 1.4 is firmly attached to the surface of the cylinder all around the circumference. The trail of steady and symmetric laminar shear layers does not form a visible wake in the non-separation regime.

![fig1.4](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.4.jpg)

Separation initiates at \\(Re=4\;to\;5\\), when a distinct, steady, symmetric, and _closed near-wake_ is formed, as seen in Fig. 1.5. The free shear layers meet at the end of the near-wake at the confluence point. The reverse velocity along the axis of the near-wake is usually one order of magnitude lower than the free stream velocity. This weak recirculating flow in the near-wake is known as Föppl's twin _vortices_.

![fig1.5](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.5.jpg)

The elongated closed near-wake becomes unstable for \\(Re>30-48\\) and a sinusoidal oscillation of shear layers commences at the confluence point as seen in Fig. 1.6(a). The spontaneous onset of oscillation is sensitive to disturbances and \\(Re\_{osc}\\) depends on a particular experimental arrangement. The amplitude of the trail oscillation increases with rising \\(Re\\) and for \\(Re>45-65\\) the shear layers roll up at crests and troughs as seen in Fig. 1.6(b). The final product is a staggered array of laminar eddies as seen in Fig. 1.6(c).

![fig1.6](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.6.jpg)

![fig1.7](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.7.jpg)

The procession of eddies in the laminar wake is called the _Kármán-Bénard eddy street_. The phenomenon is an instability of the laminar wake as suggest by Kovasznay(1949).

# 1.6 Transition-in-wake state of flow, TrW
The laminar periodic wake becomes unnstable at higher \\(Re\\) farther downstream in the wake as seen in Fig. 1.8(a). Gradually transition spreads upstream with increasing \\(Re\\), until the eddy becomes turbulent during its formation, Fig. 1.8(b).

![fig1.8](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.8.jpg)

Transition-in-wake state can be divided into two regimes:
* TrW1: transition of laminar eddies in the wake from \\((180-200)<Re<(220-250)\\)
* TrW2: transition of an irregular eddy during its formation; from \\((220-250)<Re<(350-400)\\)

Another important phenomenon takes place between TrW1 and TrW2 regimes. The laminar wake instability mode of eddy formation and shedding is replaced by the turbulent eddy roll up and shedding mode from the cylinder. The change of the eddy shedding mode is reflected by the different variation inshedding frequency expressed through a non-dimensional Strouhal number \\(St\\).

# 1.7 Transition-in-shear-layers, TrSL, or Subcritical state
The second transition takes place along the free shear layers while the boundary layers remain fully laminar. There are three phases of transition along the free-shear layers:
* TrSL1: development of transition waves; \\((350-400)<Re<(1k-2k)\\)
* TrSL2: formation of transition eddies; \\((1k-2k)<Re<(20k-40k)\\)
* TrSL3: burst to turbulence; \\((20k-40k)<Re<(100k-200k)\\)

The transition waves appear first as undulations of the free shear layers in Fig. 1.9(a). As \\(Re\\) increases the transition waves roll up into discrete eddies along the free shear layer before becoming turbulent and then roll up in alternate eddies, Fig. 1.9(b). Finally a sudden burst to turbulence occurs in the free shear layers near the side of the cylinder and the formation of eddies takes place close to the rear of the cylinder, Fig. 1.9(c).

![fig1.9](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.9.jpg)

# 1.8 Transition-in-boundary-layers, TrBL, or Critical state
The following names for the new regimes are suggested:
* TrBL0: precritical regime; \\((100k-200k)<Re<(300k-340k)\\)
* TrBL1: one-bubble regime; \\((300k-340k)<Re<(380k-400k)\\)
* TrBL2: two-bubble regime; \\((380k-400k)<Re<(0.5M-1M)\\)
* TrBL3: supercritical regime; \\((0.5M-1M)<Re<(3.4M-6M)\\)
* TrBL4: post-critical regime; \\((3.5M-6M)<Re<(unknown)\\)

![fig1.10](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.10.jpg)

The _precritical regime_ is characterized by the first onset of transition in free shear layers along separation lines. The inherent three-dimensionality of the onset of the transition disturbed the near-wake and delayed the eddy formation in Fig. 1.10(a) as opposed to Fig. 1.9(b). This resulted in an initial fall in the drag coefficient while the eddy shedding remained prominent as seen in Fig. 1.10(a).

The precritical regime, TrBL0, terminates abruptly at certain \\(Re\\) with a discontinuous fall in the drag coefficient and with a jump in the frequency of eddy shedding. Bearman(1969) found that on one side of the cylinder the free shear layers underwent sufficient transition to be able to reattach onto the cylinder surface. The closed thin separated region was termed a separation _bubble_. The subsequent turbulent separation was considerably delayed in TrBL1, as seen in Fig. 1.10(b).

The asymmetric single=bubble regime, TrBL1, terminates at higher \\(Re\\) with yet aother discontinuous fall in the drag and a jump in the shedding frequency when a second bubble is formed on the other side of the cylinder, Fig. 1.10(c). The symmetric _two-bubble regime_, TrBL2, represents an intricate combination of laminar separation, transition, reattachment and turbulent separation of the boundary layers on both sides of the cylinder. TrBL1 and TrBL2 regimes are very sensitive to disturbances and can be eliminated by a sufficiently rough surface and/or turbulent free stream.

Further increase in \\(Re\\) brings transition to the primary laminar separation line in an irregular manner. This leads to the disruption and fragmentation of separation bubbles along the span of the cylinder. The irregularly fragmented separation lines prevent periodic eddy shedding, as seen in Fig. 1.10(d). The latter is the main feature of the _super-critical regime_, TrBL3.

Roshko(1961) discovered that regular eddy shedding reappears at higher \\(Re\\) when the boundary layers are turbulent before separation all along the span. It is called _postcritical regime_. The postcritical TrBL4 regime is characterized by the transition in boundary layers being somewhere between the stagnation and separation lines. As \\(Re\\) increases the transition region advances towards the stagnation line asymptotically and hence the value of \\(Re\\) for the upper end of TrBL4 is hard to define.

# 1.9 Fully trubulent state of flow, T
This state of flow is reached when all disturbed flow regions around the cylinder are turbulent. The flow past the cylinder in the T-state, and the associated drag and eddy shedding, are expected to be invariant provided that the influencing parameters are kept small. However, this becomes hardly possible because compressibility effects in air and cavitation in water cannot be avoided at very high \\(Re\\) and they become governing parameters.

# 1.10 Variation of fluid-dynamic force
\\[C=2F/\rho V^2DL\tag{1.1}\\]
 The fluctuating fluid-dynamic drag and lift forces are denoted by \\(C\_{D}'\\) and \\(C\_{L}'\\) and the time-averaged values by \\(C\_D\\) and \\(C\_L\\). The drag force is produced by viscous friction along the surface \\(C\_{Df}\\) and by an unsymmetric pressure distribution on the upstream and downstrean side of the cylinder \\(C\_{Dp}\\):
 \\[C\_D=C\_{Df}+C\_{Dp}\tag{1.2}\\]

 Figure 1.11 shows the variation of all six force coefficients across a whole \\(Re\\) range for an almost disturbance-free flow around a nominally two-dimensional cylinder. The viscous friction denoted by \\(C\_{Df}\\) is significant in the laminar state L but becomes negligible beyond the end of TrSL state of flow.

![fig1.11](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.11.jpg)

The three minimum values of \\(C\_{Dp}\\) correspnd to:
1. the elongated, steady and closed near-wake at the end of L2;
2. the longest length of the eddy formation region between TrSL1 and TrSL2;
3. the separation bubbles on both sides of the cylinder in TrBL2.

The discontinuous fall in \\(C\_D\\) and the appearance of mean \\(C\_L\\) occur at the beginning of the single-bubble regime. TrBL1 is followed by a discontinuous fall in \\(C\_D\\) and \\(C\_L\\) at the start of the two-bubble regime TrBL2. There is a wide variation of local \\(C\_D\\) along the span in the supercritical regime TrBL3.

\\(C\_{L}'\\) is always greater than \\(C\_{D}'\\). The latter has two components: \\(C\_{DS}'\\), which is sinusoidal and \\(C\_{Dt}'\\) which is random and produced by turbulence. \\(C\_{L}'\\) also has two components: \\(C\_{LS}'\\) and \\(C\_{Lt}'\\)(expect in the L3 regime), \\(C\_{LS}'\\) is dominant in TrW2 and TrSL3 and vanishes in TrBL3. In TrBL4, \\(C\_{LS}'\\) is of the same order of magnitude as \\(C\_{Lt}'\\). The first \\(C\_{Lmax}'\\) seen in Fig. 1.11 corresponds to the shortest formation distance of laminar eddies from the cylinder, and the second \\(C\_{Lmax}'\\) is related to the shortest formation distance of turbulent eddies from the cylinder.
