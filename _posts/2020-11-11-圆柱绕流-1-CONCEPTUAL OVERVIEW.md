# 1.1 Regions of disturbed flow
A particularly large and usually unsteady separated flow is generated by so-called _bluff_ bodies.

Figure 1.1 shows the division of the disturbed flow field into four regions:
1. one narrow region of retarded flow
2. two boundary layers attached to the surface of the cylinder
3. two sidewise regions of displaced and accelerated flow
4. one wide downstream region of separated flow called the wake

![fig1.1](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.1.jpg)

The unexpectedly high fluctuations in velocity are found in the upstream retarded flow region, which significantly increase local heat transfer. The inherently unstable retarded flow forms unsteady flow structures in a streamline direction.

The boundary layers around the cylinder are subjected to a favourable pressure gradient followed by a small region of adverse pressure gradient before separation. The separated boundary layers continue to develop downstream as _fre shear layers_ abd they initially border the _near-wake_.

The displaced flow is vigorously entrained by the low pressure in the wake. The extent of the displaced region is strongly affected by the vicinity of confining walls of wind or water tunnels known as the _blockage effect_.

Large flow structures are formed in the near-wake and gradually decay along the wake. The formation and decay of the flow structures in the wake depend on the state of flow which may be laminar, transitional, or turbulent.

# 1.2 Transition in disturbed regions
Figure 1.2 shows the development of transitions with \\(Re\\) in three disturbed regions: wake(TrW), shear layers(TrSL) and boundary layers(TrBL).

![fig1.2](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.2.jpg)

Each transition is sensitive to very small disturbances of various kinds. The disturbances can initiate transitions at a lower \\(Re\_c\\) and sometimes may significantly modify the resulting flow structures. This means that \\(Re\\) is expected to be a single _governing_ parameter only for the _disturbance-free_ flow around cylinders.

The first transition TrW sketched in Fig. 1.2(a) occurred in the wake, and was discovered in the range of \\(Re\\) one order of magnitude lower than in pipe flow experiments. Turbulance gradually developed and spread all along the wake, but the free shear layers bordering the near-wake remained laminar.

The second transition TrSL in Fig. 1.2(b) occurred in the free shear layers. The transition region moved with increasing \\(Re\\) along the free shear layers towards the separation and affected the length and width of the near-wake.

The third transition reaches the boundary layers at separation in Fig. 1.2(c). Subsequent researchers gradually revealed an extremely complicated interaction between separation and transition, resulting in different flow structures until finally the boundary layer became fully turbulent before the separation line.

The transition in boundary layers continues to move towards the stagnation point with rising \\(Re\\) as sketched in Fig. 1.2(d). At the upper end of TrBL, the transition reaches the retarded region and this is the end of the third and final transition because all regions of the disturbed flow are fully turbulent. It may be re-interated that laminar and fully turbulent states of flow past circular cylinders are separated by three distinct transition states taking place sequentially in the different disturbed regions.

# 1.3 Governing and influencing parameters
The Reynolds number \\(Re\\) has been singled out as the _governing_ parameter for idealized _disturbance-free_ flow around a _nominally_ two-dimensional cylinder. When a given _influencing_ parameter exceeds a certain magnitude it may become the _governing_ parameter in some transition states. 

However, when an influencing parameter becomes a governing one it cannot be precisely defined. Sarpkaya(1983) points out that what may be an influencing parameter for a given set of governing parameters could be a governing parameter for another set of governing parameters.

![fig1.3](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.3.jpg)

Some typical examples of the most frequently encountered influencing parameters are irregular, steady and periodic disturbances. The most common disturbance in all practical applications is _free stream turbulance_, Fig. 1.3(a). It is described by the intensity \\(Ti\\), scale \\(Ts\\) and frequency spectrum FS of random three-dimensional fluctuations of velocity. The free stream turbulance strongly affects all three transitions in the disturbed regions.

Another kind of irregular disturbance which is important for most practical applications is _surface roughness_, Fig. 1.3(b). This is characterized by at least two influencing parameters: relative size of roughness \\(K/D\\) and its texture. 

An additional steady disturbance occurs in most experiments and it is not present in applications. That is the wall _blockage_. The confining walls of wind and water tunnels shown in Fig. 1.3(c) restrict the disturbed flow sidewise and impose an additional pressure gradient. For large blockage ratios, the transitions in both the boundary and free shear layers may be affected. An asymmetric 'blockage' is induced by the vicinity of a single boundary, Fig. 1.3(d). For small gap to diameter ratios, \\(G/D\\) may become a governing parameter.

A disguised kind of disturbance is the _end effect_. In most tests both ends of the cylinder penetrate the boundary layers of the side walls as shown in Fig. 1.3(e) and the ensuing interaction affects the flow along the span of the cylinder. The _aspect ratio_ \\(L/D\\) is an ever-present influencing parameter in the simulation of a 'nominally' two-dimensional cylinder. The aspect ratio becomes a governing parameter for a short finite cylinder with a free end, see Fig. 1.3(f).

A powerful disturbance which is capable of overriding all other disturbances is the transvers or streamwise oscillation of the cylinder beyond a threshold amplitude, Fig. 1.3(g) and Fig. 1.3(h), respectively. The amplitude and frequency of either free or forced oscillations may become the governing parameters within a certain range of the free stream velocity.

# 1.4 Disturbance-free flow regimes
The flow regimes are expected to be confined within a _fixed_ range of \\(Re\\) only for _genuinely_ disturbance free flows. All influencing parameters are kept as small as possible.

The state of flow may be fully laminar L, any one of the three transitions TrW, TrSL, and TrBL, or fully turbulent T.

# 1.5 Laminar state of flow, L
There are at least three basic flow regimes:
* L1: 'creeping' flow or _non-separation_ regime; \\(0<Re<4;to;5\\)
* L2: steady separation or _closed near-wake_ regime; \\(4;to;5<Re<30;to;48\\)
* L3: _periodic laminar_ regime; \\(30;to;48<Re<180;to;200\\)

Creeping flow as seen in Fig. 1.4 is firmly attached to the surface of the cylinder all around the circumference. The trail of steady and symmetric laminar shear layers does not form a visible wake in the non-separation regime.

![fig1.4](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.4.jpg)

Separation initiates at \\(Re=4;to;5\\), when a distinct, steady, symmetric, and _closed near-wake_ is formed, as seen in Fig. 1.5. The free shear layers meet at the end of the near-wake at the confluence point. The reverse velocity along the axis of the near-wake is usually one order of magnitude lower than the free stream velocity. This weak recirculating flow in the near-wake is known as Föppl's twin _vortices_.

![fig1.5](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.5.jpg)

The elongated closed near-wake becomes unstable for \\(Re>30-48\\) and a sinusoidal oscillation of shear layers commences at the confluence point as seen in Fig. 1.6(a). The spontaneous onset of oscillation is sensitive to disturbances and \\(Re\_{osc}\\) depends on a particular experimental arrangement. The amplitude of the trail oscillation increases with rising \\(Re\\) and for \\(Re>45-65\\) the shear layers roll up at crests and troughs as seen in Fig. 1.6(b). The final product is a staggered array of laminar eddies as seen in Fig. 1.6(c).

![fig1.6](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.6.jpg)

![fig1.7](/img/flow-past-circular-cylinder/fig1.7.jpg)

The procession of eddies in the laminar wake is called the _Kármán-Bénard eddy street_. The phenomenon is an instability of the laminar wake as suggest by Kovasznay(1949).
