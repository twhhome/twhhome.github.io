# 1.1 Regions of disturbed flow
A particularly large and usually unsteady separated flow is generated by so-called _bluff_ bodies.

Figure 1.1 shows the division of the disturbed flow field into four regions:
1. one narrow region of retarded flow
2. two boundary layers attached to the surface of the cylinder
3. two sidewise regions of displaced and accelerated flow
4. one wide downstream region of separated flow called the wake

The unexpectedly high fluctuations in velocity are found in the upstream retarded flow region, which significantly increase local heat transfer. The inherently unstable retarded flow forms unsteady flow structures in a streamline direction.
