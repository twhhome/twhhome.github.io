# 1.1 Regions of disturbed flow
A particularly large and usually unsteady separated flow is generated by so-called _bluff_ bodies.<br>
Figure 1.1 shows the division of the disturbed flow field into four regions:
1. one narrow region of retarded flow
2. two boundary layers attached to the surface of the cylinder
3. two sidewise regions of displaced and accelerated flow
4. one wide downstream region of separated flow called the wake
